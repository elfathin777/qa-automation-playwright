## 📌 Playwright Automation Testing Project

**(Work in Progress)**

This repository contains an **automation testing project** built using **Playwright**, focusing on practicing web UI automation through a step-by-step development approach.

The project is currently **in progress**, starting with **basic login automation** using standard Playwright syntax. More advanced approaches such as **Data-Driven Testing (DDT)** will be introduced in future updates.

## 🚧 Project Status

🔄 **Ongoing / In Progress**

* Current implementation: **Login automation (basic syntax)**
* Framework and test structure are under active development
* The project is updated **regularly as new features are added**

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project aims to:

* Build a solid foundation in **Playwright automation**
* Practice writing clean and readable automation tests
* Gradually evolve from basic automation to more advanced patterns
* Serve as a **QA Automation learning and portfolio project**

## 🧪 Current Automation Scope

### Implemented Feature

**Login Automation**

* Successful login scenario
* Failed login scenario (invalid credentials)
* Basic assertions to validate login behavior

> Test cases are currently implemented using **direct Playwright syntax** without data-driven logic.

## 🔁 Automation Approach

* Direct Playwright test scripting
* Clear separation between test steps and assertions
* Simple and readable test flow for learning purposes

Future updates will include:

* Data-Driven Testing (DDT)
* Reusable functions or page abstraction
* Improved test structure and scalability
